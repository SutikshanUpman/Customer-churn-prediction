# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Project

This repository contains an end-to-end workflow covering data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of both traditional Machine Learning models and Deep Learning architectures.

---

## üß† Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate predictive models using both classical ML techniques and neural network-based approaches.  
The notebook walks through the entire ML pipeline ‚Äî from data loading to final evaluation.

## üìä Key Components

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Data loading using **Pandas**
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Feature scaling and encoding
- Train-test split for model validation

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualization of data distributions using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Correlation heatmaps and feature relationships
- Insights derived from data patterns

### 3. **Machine Learning Models**
- Implemented using **Scikit-learn**
- Models may include:
  - Linear/Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees or Random Forests
  - SVM or KNN classifiers
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

### 4. **Deep Learning Models**
- Implemented using **TensorFlow** or **Keras**
- Neural network architecture includes:
  - Input, hidden, and output layers
  - Dropout regularization to prevent overfitting
- Model training, validation, and visualization of learning curves
